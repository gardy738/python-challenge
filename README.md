# Python-Challenge
The time has finally come to set VBA and Excel to the side and enter the big boys league.

In this assignment, I worked on two real-world challenges;

## PyBank
In this challenge, I was provided with the financial records of a company, and was tasked to write a python script to perform the following:
* Provide the total months of record
* Calculate the total net amount of Profits/Losses of the financial company over the entire period
* Calculate the changes in profit/loss, then the average change in profit/loss over the entire record
* Determine the greatest increase amount in profits over the entire period, and the date that increase occurred
* Determine the greatest decrease amount in profits over the entire period, and also the date it occurred

The results of the analysis looks like this: 

## PyPoll
In this challenge, I had to do a little bit more than the previous one. After the election  in small, rural town, I was tasked to help modernize the vote counting process. 
I was provided with the election data file, and had to complete the following tasks:
* Display the total number of votes cast
* Provide the full list of candidates who received votes
* Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
* Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won
* Most importantly, present, based on the results, the candidate who won the elections.

For both challenges, the results are exported on a summarized excel file for convenient access.
